# This script will high alch onyx bolts (e) for you, provided you are at the grand exchange. It will buy the bolts (your last two offer spots (members) should be unused), the nature runes, and then alch them all before repeating. You can set the "buyinc" variable to some positive number if you want to buy more bolts/runes for every run (do this if you are making a profit).
